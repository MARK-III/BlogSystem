#Homemade Tiny Blog

Nowadays it is quite simple to have your own blog. Thousands free blog providers are out there. With some clicks and without even basic knowledge of computer science, you are a blogger. But being as myself, I am not satisfied with any blog provider on this earth.(Yes such a big asshole I am.) So, I would like to make my own blog from skrech.

Here are some background of this project:  

* I would like to build tech stacks as much as possible.(I won't write an OS for it, of cource.)
* I would like to make my code short and simple.
* ~~I am poor~~ I don't want to spend much money on it.
