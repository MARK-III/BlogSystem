#  Tao of Computer Science

Recently I have read an article said that a man can master an area within 11 years. Being as a mordern man, normally the expectation is around 80 years. So we could possibly master in 11 different areas. Till now, I am a master of nothing, obviously I have wasted my life for the first two 11 years. I would like to choose computer science as the third 11 year goal. The pursuit of tao of CS, I called it. I've been working on it since 12. 6 more years to go. Let's see what will happen.

original: maths micro circuit  
basic: algorithm datastructure  
mi: language(complier, functional programming)  
mi2: design pattern
middle: os(system call,tpc/ip)  
high1: system design   
high2: gui

tasks1: algorithm in C leetcode
